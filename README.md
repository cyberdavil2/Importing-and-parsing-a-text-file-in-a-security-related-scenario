<h1>Importing and parsing a text file in a security-related scenario</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this activity, I created a new portfolio document showcasing my proficiency in using Python for developing algorithms involving file handling tasks. The document includes screenshots or typed versions of Python code, accompanied by detailed explanations of syntax, functions, and keywords utilized in the algorithms. A project description section provides an overview of the objective, while a summary at the end highlights key insights gained. Specific details on using the with statement, open() function, .read() and .write() methods, .split() method, for loop, and .remove() method are provided, demonstrating practical experience in file manipulation tasks. By meeting these requirements, the portfolio document effectively demonstrates my proficiency in using Python for file handling tasks, showcasing practical skills in algorithm development and programming.
